For this resume, the most important technology used was the use of flex box to allow for me to create a responsive HTML file. Because this was a resume, it needed to be set up as a two column grid, that would snap into a single column at a certain point. The other major aspect I needed to use correctly was the use of lists/unordered lists as most of the information for this resume was lists of certain accomplishments and information about me as a designer. Combining both of these allowed for me to create a visually crisp, playful, and responsive html file.

As previously mentioned, two things I wanted for my resume to be were crisp and playful. Every single choice I made in terms of visuals for this assignment went into the making sure both of these came to fruition. With that being said, incorporating my handwritten name, the yellow gif of the three bearded men, and the overall presence of the color yellow overall. My font choices were important as well, using Not Serif JP for all my header text, and Oswald for my body text. While one is a serif and the other is a san-serif, I found both of them to be clean, geometric, but playful when combined with the yellow lines I provided to break up the different categories. Going forward, using both of these type faces in addition to slight yellow accents will allow for me to create a clear visual identity not only in my resume, but in my portfolio site as well.
